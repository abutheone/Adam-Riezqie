# Lab 2: Cryptographic Attacks: Cracking Weak Password Hashes and Exploiting Poor Authentication in Databases

**🎯 Objective:**
  1. Identify and exploit cryptographic weaknesses in database authentication and password storage.
  2. Perform offline hash cracking after discovering password hashes in a vulnerable database.
  3. Investigate real-world cryptographic failures and propose secure solutions.
  4. Document findings clearly in GitHub (Markdown) and present a short demo/brief.
