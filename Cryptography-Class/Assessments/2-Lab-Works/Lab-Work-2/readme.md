# Lab 2: Cryptographic Attacks: Cracking Weak Password Hashes and Exploiting Poor Authentication in Databases

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
1. Identify and exploit cryptographic weaknesses in database authentication and password storage.
2. Perform offline hash cracking after discovering password hashes in a vulnerable database.
3. Investigate real-world cryptographic failures and propose secure solutions.
4. Document findings clearly in GitHub (Markdown) and present a short demo/brief.
