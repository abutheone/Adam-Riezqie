# Lab 1: Cryptographic Attacks: Brute Force and Traffic Analysis on Network Protocols

## üéØ Objective

1. Explore **vulnerabilities** in common network protocols (FTP, TELNET, SSH & HTTP).
3. Perform brute force attacks to recover passwords.
4. Use recovered credentials to sniff network traffic.
5. Analyze the security posture of each protocol.
6. Propose effective mitigation strategies.

## üîç Lab Tasks

### Task 1: Enumerate the Vulnerable VM to Discover Usernames

#### ‚úÖ Objective:
- Identify potential usernames for brute force attacks.

#### üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è The Process:

1. Performed a port scan using Nmap:
   
    ```
    nmap -sV -p 21,23,22,80 [target-ip]
    ```
    | Option              | Meaning                                                                                                                                       |
   |---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | `nmap`              | Runs the Nmap network scanner tool.                                                                                                           |
   | `-sV`               | **Service/version detection** ‚Äî Nmap will try to determine what software and version is running on each open port.                          |
   | `-p 21,23,22,80`    | Tells Nmap to scan **only** these specific ports: <br>‚Ä¢ `21` = FTP <br>‚Ä¢ `23` = Telnet <br>‚Ä¢ `22` = SSH <br>‚Ä¢ `80` = HTTP                    |
   | `[target-ip]`       | Replace with the IP address of the target/vulnerable machine you are scanning.

   ![image](nmap-scan-open-port-on-target-machine.png)
   > Here I only scan FTP(21), TELNET(23), SSH(22) and HTTP(80) port.

3. Connected manually to Telnet to observe any information:
  ```
  telnet [target-ip]
  ```
  ![image](telnet-to-target-machine.png)
  > Here we got the username and password: ```msfadmin:msfadmin```. Bear in mind, we often do not get the credentials as easily as this.

### 2.  Perform Brute Force Attacks
#### 2.1. FTP, TELNET, and SSH

#### ‚úÖ Objective:
- Use Hydra perform brute force attacks against the following protocols:

##### FTP
  ```
  hydra -L rockyou.txt -P rockyou.txt ftp://[target-ip]
  ```
  ![image](hydra-bruteforce-ftp.png)
  
##### TELNET
  ```
  hydra -L rockyou.txt -P rockyou.txt telnet://[target-ip]
  ```
  ![image](hydra-bruteforce-telnet.png)

#### 2.2. HTTP
> Since we know the target machine has port 80 open. We can use web browser to open it
